<h1>Shape Wizard</h1>

<p><strong>Shape Wizard</strong> is a basic website to calculate the area of 2D shapes and the volume of 3D shapes using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Users choose between 2D or 3D shapes.</li>
  <li>They see a grid of shape options and pick one.</li>
  <li>Each shape has its own page to enter values (like radius or height).</li>
  <li>JavaScript calculates the result and displays it on a new result page.</li>
  <li>A back button lets users try another shape.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong> - Structure</li>
  <li><strong>CSS</strong> - Layout, colors, and design effects</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - Interactivity and calculations</li>
  <li><strong>AI Tools</strong> - Layout design, formatting, and error fixing</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Learned</h2>
<p>We gained hands-on experience in basic web development and saw how structure, style, and logic work together to create a working product. It also showed us the value of AI tools in coding and design.</p>

<h2>How to Run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download or clone the repository.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Shape Wizard</strong> was a fun and educational project that boosted our confidence in building websites.</p>
